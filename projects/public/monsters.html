                    The Imps are Human-sized humanoid Demons and also the most common enemies in DOOM games,
                     thus being considered the "backbone" of all hellspawn in the entire franchise.

                <p class="MonstersText">
                    The Pinkies (also known as Demons) are a recurring enemy found in the classic games.
                    Alongside their partially invisible counterpart, they are one of the most common enemies the players will come across, 
                    second only to the Imps. Pinkies makes their first appearance in the third level of the first episode.
                    The Demons (also commonly known as the Pinkies or Bull Demons) are demonic monsters found in all classic DOOM games up to date.
                    The id Software staff has called these monsters "Pinkies"

                    The Lost Soul was first introduced in Doom's second episode, The Shores of Hell, 
                    but can be seen as early as E1M1 on the PlayStation and Saturn ports of the game where they can be spawned by 
                    a Pain Elemental hidden in a secret corridor.

                <p class="MonstersText">
                    They primarily attack by spitting a ball of plasma from their mouth at a distance, 
                    or biting with their gaping maw up close. The fireballs travel in a similar manner to the Imp's,
                    going at a straight line non-stop until it hits its target, an object, or a wall. When under attack, 
                    the Cacodemon often seems to distance itself, though the cause of this is that it is being pushed back by enduring direct hits.
