                        The shotgun is one of the most versatile and useful weapons in the Doom player's arsenal,
                         equipped in all classic Doom games. It's a single-barreled, pump-action shotgun with a wooden stock.

                    The BFG9000 appears as a bulky steel-grey gun which fires large balls of green plasma 
                    (40 cells per blast). For general purposes it can be considered the most powerful weapon in the game.
                    known as Big Fu*king Gun.

                    The chainsaw (uncommonly referred to as "The Great Communicator") is a melee-based weapon that has appeared in every Doom title in the series.
                     This weapon mutilates enemies close enough to contact. At 525 hits per minute, it's roughly a quadruple-speed fist.
                      It is often used because it conserves ammo, while its "rapid fire" works well on enemies with high pain chance,
                       which minimizes damage in melee situations. The Classic Doom chainsaws brand name is from Beartooth/Eagle Beaver(McCulloch),
                        while the Doom 3 chainsaw is by Mixom, and the 2016's brand name is Painsaw, an unknown brand name.
